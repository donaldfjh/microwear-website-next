# The Science Behind Microwear’s Directional Audio Technology

## The #1 Challenge in Open-Ear Eyewear: Privacy

For global importers and brand owners entering the smart eyewear market, the biggest hesitation is often **sound leakage**. Consumers love the idea of "open-ear" listening—staying aware of their surroundings without blocking their ear canals. But they hate the idea of their private phone calls being broadcast to everyone in the elevator or office.

If smart glasses sound like tiny loudspeakers strapped to your head, they fail as a consumer product.

At **Microwear**, we understand that privacy isn't just a feature; it's a necessity. That’s why our latest AI Smart Glasses (Series AI 3 & AI 4) utilize advanced Directional Audio Technology to solve this pain point. Here is how we did it.

## What is Directional Audio?

Unlike traditional bone conduction (which can cause uncomfortable vibrations) or standard speakers (which spray sound in all directions), Directional Audio works like a focused beam of light.

Think of a standard speaker as a lightbulb—it illuminates the whole room. Think of Microwear’s Directional Audio as a laser pointer—it hits only the intended target.

## The Mechanics: How It Works

We engineer our audio cavities using a specific acoustic structure that controls the propagation of sound waves.

**1.Precise Angle Delivery:** The speakers are positioned and angled within the temple arms to fire sound waves directly into the user's ear canal. This minimizes the distance sound has to travel, reducing the energy lost to the surrounding air.

**2.Phase Cancellation Technology:** This is the game-changer. Our system emits a secondary "inverse" sound wave towards the outside of the glasses. When this inverse wave meets the leaking sound wave, they effectively cancel each other out.

## The Result: A "Private Sound Field"

By combining physical cavity design with acoustic algorithms, we create a Private Sound Field around the user's ears.

**At 100% Volume:** The user experiences rich, immersive audio.

**At 0.5 Meters Away:** The sound is virtually inaudible to colleagues or commuters in a typical environment (office, cafe, or subway).

## Why This Matters for Your Brand

For B2B buyers, this technology translates directly into sales arguments and lower return rates:

**Office Friendly:** Users can take Zoom calls or listen to music at their desks without disturbing coworkers.

**Secure Calls:** Great for business professionals who need to take calls while driving or walking without sharing sensitive information with bystanders.

**Better Reviews:** Eliminating the "loudspeaker effect" significantly improves end-user satisfaction scores.

## Experience It Yourself

Charts and theories are great, but audio products must be heard to be believed. We invite interested distributors and brands to test our "Anti-Leakage" performance against competitors.
